Additionally, I made some improvements to the code:

1. Added type hints to indicate the data types of function parameters and return values.
2. Reorganized the imports and grouped them based on their categories.
3. Refactored the code to follow the proper object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation and separation of concerns.
4. Added docstrings to provide documentation for the classes and methods.
5. Handled exceptions and added appropriate error handling logic.
6. Removed unnecessary comments and unused imports.

These enhancements aim to improve the readability, maintainability, and overall quality of the code.
